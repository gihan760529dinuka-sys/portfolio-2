<!-- CONTRACT LAW -->
<section id="contract">
  <h2>1. Contract Law (Simple English)</h2>

  <h3>What is a contract?</h3>
  <p>A contract is a promise that the law will enforce. For a promise to become a contract, 5 things are needed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Offer:</strong> One person makes a clear proposal to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> The other person says “yes” exactly as offered.</li>
    <li><strong>Consideration (Justa Causa):</strong> Something of value moves between the parties (money, work, goods).</li>
    <li><strong>Intention to create legal relations:</strong> Both sides must want the law to step in if someone breaks the promise.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal form:</strong> Most contracts can be spoken or written, but a few must be in writing by law.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Offer rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can be made to one person, a group, or the whole world (example: reward advert).</li>
    <li>Must be communicated to the offeree.</li>
    <li>Ends if it is revoked (taken back), rejected, or a time limit passes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Acceptance rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Must be an exact “mirror” of the offer (no new conditions).</li>
    <li>Silence is not acceptance.</li>
    <li>Usually must reach the offeror, except:
      <ul>
        <li>Post rule: if post is the expected way, acceptance is complete as soon as the letter is posted.</li>
        <li>Unilateral contracts: doing the act (like using the smoke ball) is enough; no need to tell anyone.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Invitation to treat (not an offer)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Goods on shop shelves, adverts, auction ads = invitations to start talks, not firm offers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Terms of the contract</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Express terms:</strong> actually spoken or written.</li>
    <li><strong>Implied terms:</strong> added by law, custom or court to make the contract work.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> vital terms. If broken, the innocent side can end the contract and claim damages.</li>
    <li><strong>Warranties:</strong> smaller terms. Only damages can be claimed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ending a contract</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>By full performance (job done).</li>
    <li>By agreement (both sides agree to stop).</li>
    <li>By breach of a condition.</li>
    <li>By frustration (something impossible happens, e.g. goods destroyed by flood).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Remedies if someone breaks the contract</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Damages (money).</li>
    <li>End the contract.</li>
    <li>Specific performance (court order to do what was promised).</li>
    <li>Injunction (court order to stop doing something).</li>
    <li>Payment for work already done.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<!-- AGENCY LAW -->
<section id="agency">
  <h2>2. Law of Agency (Simple English)</h2>

  <h3>What is agency?</h3>
  <p>One person (the agent) is allowed to make contracts for another person (the principal). The contract is between the principal and the third party, not the agent.</p>

  <h3>How agency is created</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Agreement:</strong> spoken or written (e.g. power of attorney).</li>
    <li><strong>Ratification:</strong> principal later approves an act done without authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Necessity:</strong> emergency forces someone to act for another.</li>
    <li><strong>Estoppel:</strong> principal’s behaviour makes others believe someone is their agent.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Duties of an agent</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Obey instructions.</li>
    <li>Act with care and skill.</li>
    <li>Do the job personally (no delegation unless allowed).</li>
    <li>Avoid conflict of interest (cannot secretly buy the goods he is asked to sell).</li>
    <li>No secret profits or bribes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rights of an agent</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Be paid the agreed commission.</li>
    <li>Be repaid for money spent or losses made while doing the job.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Types of authority</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Express:</strong> clearly given by words or writing.</li>
    <li><strong>Implied:</strong> needed to do the main job (e.g. buy stamps to post a letter).</li>
    <li><strong>Apparent/Ostensible:</strong> principal’s behaviour makes outsiders think the agent has power, even if he does not.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ending an agency</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Job finished or time expired.</li>
    <li>Either side says “I quit” or “You’re fired”.</li>
    <li>Death, bankruptcy or insanity of either side.</li>
    <li>Frustration (e.g. subject matter destroyed).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- SALE OF GOODS -->
<section id="sale">
  <h2>3. Sale of Goods (Simple English)</h2>

  <h3>What is a sale of goods?</h3>
  <p>A contract where the seller transfers or agrees to transfer ownership of movable goods to the buyer for a money price.</p>

  <h3>Types of goods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Existing goods:</strong> already owned by seller.
      <ul>
        <li>Specific: identified and agreed (this car).</li>
        <li>Unascertained: only described (30 bags of rice).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Future goods:</strong> not yet made or acquired by seller.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When does ownership (property) pass?</h3>
  <p>Rule of thumb: loss follows ownership. Five rules decide the exact moment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Specific goods in deliverable state: at contract time.</li>
    <li>Specific goods needing something done: when done and buyer told.</li>
    <li>Goods to be weighed/tested: after testing and buyer told.</li>
    <li>“Sale or return”: when buyer approves or keeps goods beyond reasonable time.</li>
    <li>Unascertained/future goods: when goods are clearly set aside for this contract with both sides agreeing.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Implied promises (terms)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Seller has right to sell (condition).</li>
    <li>Buyer will enjoy quiet possession (warranty).</li>
    <li>Goods are free from hidden charges (warranty).</li>
    <li>Goods match the description (condition).</li>
    <li>Goods are of satisfactory quality and fit for buyer’s purpose (conditions, unless defect was obvious or buyer examined and missed it).</li>
    <li>Sample sales: bulk matches sample, no hidden defects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Nemo dat rule & exceptions</h3>
  <p>“You can’t give what you don’t own.” Exceptions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mercantile agent (factor) selling goods entrusted to him.</li>
    <li>Sale under a court order or statute.</li>
    <li>Estoppel: owner acted like seller had authority.</li>
    <li>Seller remains in possession and sells to second buyer who takes in good faith.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Unpaid seller’s rights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Against goods:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Lien (keep goods till paid).</li>
        <li>Stoppage in transit (stop delivery if buyer insolvent).</li>
        <li>Resell if perishable or notice given.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Against buyer:</strong> sue for price or damages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Buyer’s remedies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sue for damages for non-delivery.</li>
    <li>Reject goods and end contract if condition broken.</li>
    <li>Claim damages for any breach.</li>
    <li>Ask court for specific performance (rare).</li>
  </ul>

<!-- NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS -->
<section id="negotiable">
  <h2>5. Negotiable Instruments (Simple English)</h2>

  <h3>What does “negotiable instrument” mean?</h3>
  <p>A signed paper that promises or orders payment of money and can be passed from one person to another by simple delivery or endorsement.</p>

  <h3>Main features</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Easy transfer (like cash).</li>
    <li>Holder can sue in his own name.</li>
    <li>A person who takes it in good faith and for value (holder in due course) gets better title than the person who gave it.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Three big types</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bill of Exchange:</strong> written order by one person to another to pay money.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheque:</strong> bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand.</li>
    <li><strong>Promissory Note:</strong> written promise to pay money.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Parties you will meet</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Drawer:</strong> person who signs the order (writes the cheque/bill).</li>
    <li><strong>Drawee/Acceptor:</strong> person who must pay (bank for cheque; anyone for bill).</li>
    <li><strong>Payee:</strong> person named to receive the money.</li>
    <li><strong>Endorser:</strong> person who signs on the back to pass it on.</li>
    <li><strong>Endorsee:</strong> person who receives it after endorsement.</li>
    <li><strong>Holder in due course:</strong> took the paper complete, on time, in good faith, paid value, no notice of defects – gets super-protected rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cheque crossing (lines on cheque)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>General crossing:</strong> two lines – cheque must be paid through any bank account.</li>
    <li><strong>Special crossing:</strong> bank name inside lines – paid only through that named bank.</li>
    <li><strong>Account-payee:</strong> words “A/C payee” – money must go into payee’s own account.</li>
    <li><strong>Not-negotiable:</strong> words “not negotiable” – transferee cannot become holder in due course; gets same title as transferor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Presentment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bills can be presented for acceptance (will you pay?) and for payment.</li>
    <li>Cheques are only presented for payment (no acceptance step).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dishonour</h3>
  <p>If a bill or cheque is not accepted or not paid, it is dishonoured. The holder must give notice of dishonour to earlier parties or lose the right to claim from them.</p>

  <h3>Endorsement styles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blank:</strong> just signature – becomes payable to bearer.</li>
    <li><strong>Special:</strong> sign and name the next person – payable to that person.</li>
    <li><strong>Restrictive:</strong> “Pay Ali only” – cannot be passed further.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional:</strong> “Pay Ben after ship arrives” – endorser liable only if condition happens, but endorsee can still sue others.</li>
    <li><strong>Sans recourse:</strong> endorser adds “sans recourse” – not liable if instrument bounces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Discharge of the instrument</h3>
  <p>Rights end when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Paid in due course.</li>
    <li>Holder cancels it.</li>
    <li>Holder gives up rights (renunciation).</li>
    <li>Important details (date, amount, name) are fraudulently changed (material alteration).</li>
  </ul>
